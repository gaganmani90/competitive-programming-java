/**
 *
 * Given a string containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*',
 * write a function to check whether this string is valid.
 * We define the validity of a string by these rules:
 *
 * Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
 * Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
 * Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
 * '*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string.
 * An empty string is also valid.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: "()"
 * Output: True
 * Example 2:
 * Input: "(*)"
 * Output: True
 * Example 3:
 * Input: "(*))"
 * Output: True
 * Note:
 * The string size will be in the range [1, 100].

    /**
     * Approach #3: Greedy [Accepted]
     * Intuition
     *
     * When checking whether the string is valid, we only cared about the "balance": the number of extra,
     * open left brackets as we parsed through the string. For example, when checking whether '(()())' is valid,
     * we had a balance of 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0 as we parse through the string: '(' has 1 left bracket, '((' has 2, '(()' has 1,
     * and so on. This means that after parsing the first i symbols, (which may include asterisks,)
     * we only need to keep track of what the balance could be.
     *
     * For example, if we have string '(***)', then as we parse each symbol,
     * the set of possible values for the balance is [1] for '('; [0, 1, 2] for '(*'; [0, 1, 2, 3] for '(**'; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] for '(***', and [0, 1, 2, 3] for '(***)'.
     *
     * Furthermore, we can prove these states always form a contiguous interval.
     * Thus, we only need to know the left and right bounds of this interval. That is, we would keep those intermediate states described above as [lo, hi] = [1, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 3].
     *
     * Algorithm
     *
     * Let lo, hi respectively be the smallest and largest
     * possible number of open left brackets after processing the current character in the string.
     *
     * If we encounter a left bracket (c == '('), then lo++,
     * otherwise we could write a right bracket, so lo--. If we encounter what can be a left bracket (c != ')'),
     * then hi++, otherwise we must write a right bracket, so hi--. If hi < 0,
     * then the current prefix can't be made valid no matter what our choices are.
     * Also, we can never have less than 0 open left brackets. At the end, we should check that we can have exactly 0 open left brackets.
     *
     * Complexity Analysis
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the string.
     * We iterate through the string once.
     *
     * Space Complexity: O(1)O(1), the space used by our lo and hi pointers. However,
     * creating a new character array will take O(N)O(N) space.
     * @param s
     * @return
